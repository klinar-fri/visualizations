# Visualization of Berzier Curves in Raylib
- Quadratic berzier curves:
    A BÃ©zier curvex is a parametric curve used in computer graphics and related fields.<br>
    A set of discrete "control points" defines a smooth, continuous curve by means of a formula.
    Let $p_1(x,y), p_2(x,y), p_3(x,y)$ be our control points, then the formula defining points on
    the curve is as follows:
    - $Lerp(p_1, p_2, t) = (p_2 - p_1)*t + p_1$
